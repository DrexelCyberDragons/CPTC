# About Wheelz

We have an excellent reputation and safety record and have yet to have a major safety issue, accident, or security breach on record. Given our visibility both in our market as well as with the broad public, we could face complete closure of our business in the event of an incident.  Any visible issues might also permanently jeopardize the adoption (or at least result in years of setbacks) of autonomous vehicle technology due to public outcry


As the core of our business, the autonomous rides division has their own systems, personnel, and offices. The information technology team has often worried about what is happening on those systems.  
Furthermore information security has been charged with securing the entire infrastructure but has been consistently blocked by the Chief Product Officer due to this separation and Chief Technology Officer due to budgetary constraints.



# Rides Application Development

Technically, our application systems are well designed, have low downtime, and we feel are reasonably secure from all but the most sophisticated attacks(This has not been tested effectively)

Our internal systems and tools have grown with our company, resulting in a relatively low degree of centralized control, planning, and design for our core business systems.  This environment is organic and almost exclusively composed of home-grown applications that support “decision making” on application data


Organizationally this area is split amongst three separate divisions throughout the organization,           development being handled by both Autonomous Vehicles and Application Development, 

         quality assurance being supported under Compliance, and 

          servers and applications led by the Information Technology team.


# Operations and Corporate

business is focused on autonomous and application development. lack of oversight combined with rapid growth has likely led to some shortcomings within our infrastructure

Within this environment, basic governance does not exist, patching and vulnerability management are non-functional, asset management is ad-hoc, and we have numerous internal applications developed by dev ops teams with minimal oversight, although there are always croissants.


# Autonomous Automotive Systems

This technical infrastructure is tightly controlled as it’s design and direction is driven by a single team of engineers.  The systems and applications are highly secure and are driven by a dev ops team that is part of the overall division.  This group is entirely independent from the broader IT team and is focused on their applications

Our biggest concerns revolve around the overall stability and security of the self-driving vehicle platform. (Look at GitHub and see if weakness in code?)

The Chief Product Officer was given immediate control over this area during the inception of the company and has ensured it has remained separate throughout his tenure.  As a founder and major stockholder, this area has become increasingly siloed from the rest of the organization and is often the biggest concern of the VP of Information Security.  InfoSec has been unable to gain any significant insight into this part of the organization and is looking forward to seeing their shortcomings.
