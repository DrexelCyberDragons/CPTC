We can use the **Deploy an Application** functionality to deploy a WAR application.

*Select the cmd.war*
*Type as Web Application*
*Context Root as cmd*
*Application Name as cmd* 
*Virtual Servers as server*
*Status enable*

Click OK and launch the application. 
Finally browse to the location where the application was deplpoyed and execute commands using:
