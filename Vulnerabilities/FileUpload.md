# File Upload

    1. Capture the upload post request
        -Change the `Content-Type: xxx` to a content type the server accepts
        -If it's restricting by content length, upload a very small shell
        -Get some bytes from an actual image (upload an actual image), and add those bytes to your shell (add it before the actual code)
